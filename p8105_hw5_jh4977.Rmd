# **Q1**
Set a function if there are same birthdays, then the length will smaller than n.
```{r}
duplicate_birth = function(n){
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  return(length(unique(birthdays)) < n)
}
```

Test
```{r}
duplicate_birth(5)
```

Run 10000 from 2:50, use mean to calculate the probability
```{r}
simulate = function(n, rep = 10000) {
  results = replicate(rep, duplicate_birth(n))
  mean(results)
}
```

```{r}
library(tibble)
group = 2:50
prob = sapply(group, simulate)

table = tibble(
  group_size = group,
  probability = prob
)
```
## Comment
The plot shows that when the group size reaches 23, the probability exceeds 0.5, meaning that in a group of 23 people, there’s already more than a 50% chance that at least two share a birthday.
